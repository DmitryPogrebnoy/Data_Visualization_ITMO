# Covid-19 Country Spread ðŸ’‰

This is a project to visualize the spread of coronavirus in different countries ðŸ˜· <br>
From the charts we can find out which country is better to stay in during the next epidemic ðŸ˜ƒ

Visualization is available [here](https://dmitrypogrebnoy.github.io/Data_Visualization_ITMO/)

For the project, we used two datasets - [first one](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rinichristy/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic) with coronavirus metrics by country and 
the second about countries and their parts of the world.

The project contains two views. 
The first view is the number of coronavirus cases by country on the map. 
This view will allow you to mark the countries with the highest number of cases,
as well as countries with a lower cases.

The second view is a bar chart with the top 10 countries in terms of the number 
of cases. According to this graph, we can conclude that if a country appeared in this top, 
then most likely it is not the best place to wait out the epidemic.

Each view has a handy slider and spread animation. Enjoy the movie!

Based on all views, we can conclude that one of the safest places is Australia! ðŸ¦˜ <br>
Well, next time you can think hard about spending a couple of years with kangaroos during the next global epidemic.
